/// Drives camera → detector and publishes what the live overlay needs to
/// render. This is deliberately app-shell code (lives here, not in the
/// `RiftboundVision` library) — it exists to make the detection pipeline's
/// current state visible on screen.
///
/// Detection architecture matches `feature/riftbound-scanner-prototype`'s
/// `DetectionCoordinator` on purpose: poll the latest frame on a fixed
/// interval and republish a fresh, unfiltered-by-identity array every
/// time — no `TrackedObjectID`, no zone history, no occlusion tolerance.
/// Each poll is independent, so results can flicker frame to frame the
/// way raw model output does; that's the tradeoff for not carrying any
/// tracking state that could itself go stale or wrong. Card recognition
/// is a fresh `cardDatabase` lookup per detection too, not cached.
///
/// A *second*, independent consumer reads the same polled detections for
/// game-state purposes: `expertSystemAdapter` runs its own internal
/// `ObjectTracker`/`ZoneMapper`/`TemporalEventDetector` (see
/// `ExpertSystemAdapter`) to turn them into `ObservedTableEvent`s. This is
/// deliberately not the same code path as the live overlay above — the
/// overlay wants "what's visible right now," the Expert System wants
/// "what changed, debounced and identity-stable." Reverting the overlay
/// back to tracked mode to get that would have undone the whole point of
/// the stateless redesign; running two consumers off the same detections
/// keeps both needs met without forcing one architecture to serve both.
///
/// The playmat overlay (`calibration`) starts centered on the first frame
/// and does nothing useful until the user drags its corners onto their
/// actual physical mat (see `isCalibrating`). It's purely visual for the
/// live-detection overlay above (which scans the full frame, matching the
/// prototype), but it IS what `expertSystemAdapter`'s `ZoneMapper` is
/// built from — dragging the corners into place is what makes Hand/Base/
/// Battlefield resolve to real zones for game-state ingestion instead of
/// `.unknown`.
